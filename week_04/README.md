# Week 3

This week we learned how to create bar charts using SVG (scalable vector graphics) using D3, a Javascript library. 
SVGs are handy because they can be built using set parameters/sizes that will scale to however large the display area on the page is. 
They will not pixelate, as compared to when you take a screenshot and add in .png or .jpg files.
