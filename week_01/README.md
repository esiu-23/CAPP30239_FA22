I am a second-year Master's student in the Computational Analysis & Public Policy program. I am interested in using data to help public sector organizations make decisions that are more equitable for all populations. I graduated from Princeton with a degree in Molecular Biology in 2015, and worked in healthcare consulting & technology for the past 6 years. I'm excited to pivot to a more impactful career where I can use my newly gained technical skills to further the public good.
