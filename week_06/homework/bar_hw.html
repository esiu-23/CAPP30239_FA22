            3 different charts of how people died at the hands of police.
        </p>
        <h3> Count of Manner of Death by Police</h3>
        <div id="chart1"></div>
        <h3> Number of Deaths by Police by Date</h3>

    <p>Prompt: In addition to the charts, write a paragraph explaining why you used the chart, what data point you are examining, and what supplementary information might be useful.

      Response: The bar chart displays the number of deaths by each type of manner of death. Shooting has the most deaths by far, at 1445 deaths. 
      This is not surprising since a person is most likely to die from a gunshot as opposed to tasering, but I am surprised that so many people were shot by police in 2015, at all. 
      The scatterplot shows the number of deaths by date. You can see a slight peak in the summer months as there are a greater number of shootings by police per day. 
      Finally, I tried to create a multiline chart to display deaths by race by day. Unfortunately I am not sure why the data is not appearing in a sorted order, so it's difficult to tell 
      what the trend is. But from looking at the data, I know that there are a greater number of Black people shot by police than other races.
