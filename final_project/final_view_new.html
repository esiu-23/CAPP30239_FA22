        <h1>What happened during the 102nd session of the Illinois Congress?</h1>
          
          <p>In the House, the Democrats held a majority of 73 to 45 (D to R), and in the Senate, the Democrats held a majority of 41 to 18 (D to R). The Democrats also held the governorship, giving them the state government trifecta (when one party holds both legislative chambers and the executive branch). According to the ACLU, the Illinois General Assembly (House & Senate) meets each year from January to May. They then reconvene for two weeks in the Fall to consider the Governor’s vetoes. Special sessions outside of this time frame may be called by the Governor or a joint proclamation by the presiding officers of both chambers. </p>
          <p>When the House & Senate are in session, their main duties are to develop, discuss, and pass state legislation. To become a bill, a bill must first be introduced and filed with the chamber clerk. A bill can be introduced in either the Senate or the House, but ultimately must be passed in both chambers before it is passed to the governor for review. After a bill is introduced, it is referred to a committee, which is a smaller group of legislators that focus on a specific topic. For example, there are committees that focus on consumer protection, social services, and the energy and environment. Here is a full list of all of Illinois’ state committees. After the committee votes to continue with the bill (most of the time, bills will not make it through the committee process), the chamber will debate the bill, propose possible amendments, and then ultimately vote on whether to pass the bill or not. If the chamber votes to pass the bill, the bill will then get passed to the other chamber (House or Senate), where the same process will happen all over again. Finally, if a bill makes it through both chambers, it will get passed to the governor for review & signing. To pass, a bill needs 60 votes in the House and 30 votes in the Senate.If the General Assembly chooses to override a veto by the Governor, a higher threshold of votes is needed. If the governor signs the bill, the bill finally becomes law!  If the governor vetoes the bill, the legislative branch can choose to override the veto with 71 votes in the House and 36 votes in the Senate. This happened once during the 102nd Illinois Congress. </p>
