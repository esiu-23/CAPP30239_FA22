        <h1>What happened during the 102nd session of the Illinois Congress?</h1>
        
		<h3>During the 102nd session of the Illinois Congress, 1,838 bills were introduced. Of those, 1,102 became law.</h3>
		<p> Of those, 1,102 became law. The most common action taken during the 102nd Illinois congress was referring bills to committee. One bill can be referred to committee multiple times. In total, 35,916 referrals occurred, which averages to about 19 referrals per bill. The next most common actions are readings, where the bill is read on the floor. There are first, second, and third readings. The most common reading by far is the first reading, which occurred 12,500 times. Second and third readings only occurred a combined 10,144 times.</p>
		<p>Open questions: I want to append text labels to the bubbles. How do I do that?</p>

		<h3>When the House & Senate are in session, their main duties are to develop, discuss, and pass state legislation. </h3>
		<p>To become a bill, a bill must first be introduced and filed with the chamber clerk. A bill can be introduced in either the Senate or the House, but ultimately must be passed in both chambers before it is passed to the governor for review. After a bill is introduced, it is referred to a committee, which is a smaller group of legislators that focus on a specific topic. For example, there are committees that focus on consumer protection, social services, and the energy and environment. Here is a full list of all of <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/house/committees/default.asp"> Illinois’ state committees</a>. After the committee votes to continue with the bill (most of the time, bills will not make it through the committee process), the chamber will debate the bill, propose possible amendments, and then ultimately vote on whether to pass the bill or not. If the chamber votes to pass the bill, the bill will then get passed to the other chamber (House or Senate), where the same process will happen all over again. Finally, if a bill makes it through both chambers, it will get passed to the governor for review & signing. To pass, a bill needs 60 votes in the House and 30 votes in the Senate.If the General Assembly chooses to override a veto by the Governor, a higher threshold of votes is needed. If the governor signs the bill, the bill finally becomes law!  If the governor vetoes the bill, the legislative branch can choose to override the veto with 71 votes in the House and 36 votes in the Senate. This happened once during the 102nd Illinois Congress. </p>
		
		<h3>The process from bill introduction to finally becoming law is complicated and can take a long time.</h3>
		<p>The chart below tracks the life cycle of one particular bill introduced and passed in the 102nd session of Illinois Congress. This bill, HB 1443, started as amending the Illinois Banking Act. Two amendments added in the House added clauses relating to the regulation of medical cannabis. Read the bill in full <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1443&GAID=16&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=110&GA=102"> here.</a></p>

		<h3>The most 10 most common bill topics in the 102nd Illinois Congress focused on technology </h3>
		<p>Open questions: How do I make the fonts and sizes consistent across all 3 charts?</p>
		<p>The counts used for this chart are pulled from the bill titles. The most number of bill titles contained the phrase “government-technology”, which suggests a focus on either implementing or using technology in government. The next most common bill topics focused on regulating technology, and then on using it in legal and education settings. The first non-tech related bill topic is crime, which showed up in 379 bills, and then revenue and budget related bills. Finally, the 9th and 10th most common bill topics were still focused on technology, but in the healthcare and transportation sectors. The focus of most of these bills focused on public service areas (providing funding and regulation for services), whereas the revenue and budget bills focused on public service processes. </p>
