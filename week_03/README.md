# Week 3

This week we learned how to create bar charts using SVG (scalable vector graphics) using D3, a Javascript library. 
SVGs are handy because they can be built using set parameters/sizes that will scale to however large the display area on the page is. 
They will not pixelate, as compared to when you take a screenshot and add in .png or .jpg files. 

This week's folder contains class examples: 
(Graphing COVID cases by country)
- index.html
- script.js
- covid.csv

as well as homework: 
(Graphing library branch visits in Jan 22)
- homework.html
- homework.js
- library_visits_jan22.csv

## Final Project Dataset: 

### Data source: OpenStates, https://openstates.org/data/session-json/
- #Description of data#: 
This data shows all of the bills that have been introduced, and then subsequently, what has happened to them, in all 50 states. All of the bills are labeled with subject keywords, as well as the result of the bill, and if available, the votes taken on the bill.
- #Why you are interested in this topic#: 
- Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data: I'm interested in seeing if I can find any patterns in the issues that are discussed in each state's legislatures, and what the bill results are for those issues. For example, CA and WA may be leaders in introducing climate change legislation (maybe). It'd also be interesting to see how many bills are introduced that don't passed, and if so, what issue areas these bills are in - to identify potentially more divisive issues. 
- Potential data points: Bill name, subject keywords (as categories), bill result
- Any concerns about the data: There are multiple subject keywords per bill, so some bills can get categorized more than once. I think that is OK, as I'm mostly interested in the category groupings, and the bills don't have to be in mutually exclusive categories. In an ideal world, I'd also be able to include the votes, but that data isn't available for all states.
- Identify if source is primary or secondary: Primary
